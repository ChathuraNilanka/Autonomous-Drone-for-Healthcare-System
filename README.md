# 2020-037

## Introduction

This project is created to maintain the Research Project work done by the members of group 2020-037 under the title **E-Medic - Autonomous Drone for Healthcare System** which is an online platform to deliver medicine via an autonomous drone.

## Main objective

E-Medic is a platform that connects doctors, pharmacy, patient and a delivery method (Autonomous Drone). For doctor management, E-medic uses a web portal to track a patient's medical history and upload patientsâ€™ prescriptions so that users can order their medicine with the mobile app. For drug management and order management E-medic contains a web portal for pharmacies. This portal contains functionalities to:
- Manage medicine and orders.
- Track the real-time location of the delivery.
- Autonomous drone for medicine delivery.

## Main Research Questions
- What is the most efficient and effective way to deliver medicine to patients in order to reduce the waiting time in medicine purchasing?
- What is the most convenient method for patients to handle medical prescriptions and medical records?

## Individual Research Questions

-   How to manage and handle the Information and logistics of the system?
-   How to develop the autonomous navigation system for the drone?
-   How does the drone manage to avoid obstacles in flight?
-   How to establish the connection between the patient and the drone?

## Individual Objectives

-   Platform to manage the system information and its stakeholders.
-   Fully autonomous drone navigation.
-   Detect obstacles and alter the flight path for a successful flight.
-   Connect the drone and the patient with real-time communication.
